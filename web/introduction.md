# From zero to Machine God

Not too broken for to reach the pinnacle.

## Introduction

My name is Omar and I am on an adventure to become one of the greatest engineers in computers. I am already in my mid thirties and my secondary skills are almost non-existant, which means I can't keep a job in IT for long*.

So I want to try this: Start from almost nothing and let the public decide where I am going. With just a crap laptop, sleeping in a hostel, and working part time. Donations can be used for me to get better gear, finance better living/working conditions, etc. Also with money from succeeding projects. In the future there might even be life streams or workshops, user participations, conventions, fan meets, etc.

Every day I want to hold a standup where I report on the progress, and changes.

Conversations happen through discord and social media.
